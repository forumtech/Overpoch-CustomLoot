Overpoch-CustomLoot
===================

Working Overpoch Custom Loot Package

I am adding this as many people seem to have a problem setting up custom loot on their overpoch servers. 

This pack contains the following: 
- Overpoch custom CfgBuildingPos.hpp
- Overpoch custom CfgBuildingLoot.hpp 
- Overpoch custom CfgLoot.hpp
- Overpoch custom CfgLootSmall.hpp

- Example portion of missions description.ext
- Example portion of missions init.sqf


To Install: 

1.) 
Unpack the zip file to your working directory and copy the /loottable/ folder into your mission file as is. 
This means your mission will have a new folder in it, containing the needed custom loot files. 

2.) 
Update your missions init file with the line shown in the init.sqf example

3.) 
Update your missions description.ext with the line shown in the description.ext example. 

4.) 
Restart your server and enjoy the custom loot.
